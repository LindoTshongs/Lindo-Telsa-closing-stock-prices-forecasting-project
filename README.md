# Lindo-Telsa-closing-stock-prices-forecasting-project
1.Forecasting Tesla's closing stock price using a seasonal naive model as the benchmark, then fitting a group of regression models such as regular, log-transformed, and knotted regression models. Further, we also used an Exponential Smoothing model with its variants, including damped versions. Then as a final model, a SARIMA model was used, were we used a variety of techniques to ensure stationarity. To assess the forecast errors, a variety of measures were used contained in the accuracy function, including the scale dependant measures such as the MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and (Root Mean Squared Errors) and scale independent accuracy measures such as the RMSSE (Root Mean Squared Scaled Errors) and MASE(Mean Absolute Squared Errors). Then to assess the distributional forecast accuracy, we used the Winker scores and their extention Continuous Ranked Probabilities Scores which is an extention of the Winker's Score.
