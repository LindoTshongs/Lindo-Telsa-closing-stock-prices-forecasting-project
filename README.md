# Lindo-Telsa-closing-stock-prices-forecasting-project
Forecasting Tesla's closing stock price using a seasonal naive model as the benchmark, then fitting a group of regression models such as regular, log-transformed, and knotted regression models. Further, we also used an Exponential Smoothing model with its variants, including damped versions. Then as a final model, an ARIMA model was used.
A pdf file with project and the graphics is also attached.
